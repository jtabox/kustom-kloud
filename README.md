- Just stupid customization files I use when spinning up cloud GPUs, with some settings and other personalized stuff.
- They're highly customized and not really effective since I'm very inexperienced. So not gonna work for anyone else probably, but feel free to look in this heap of garbage, maybe you find something useful or whatever. Something something one man's treasure something.
