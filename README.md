- Just stupid customization files I use when spinning up cloud GPUs, with some settings and other personalized stuff.
- They're highly customized and not really effective since I'm very inexperienced. So they're not gonna work for anyone else
- After *multiple* tries to organize this... thing, I kinda gave up and don't care either.
- But feel free to look in this heap of garbage, maybe you find something useful or whatever. Or just have a good laugh.
